I’m an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for using data to find patterns, solve problems and discover the unexpected. Having spent the last 3 years working 
as a Strategist at Advertising agency Publicis•Poke, I’m just starting my career in Data Science, and I’m looking for opportunities to combine my love of data 
and problem solving with my existing expertise in marketing and advertising. 

I’ve always been a problem solver, whether throughout my degree or in a professional capacity. Studying mathematics at the University of Bath taught me some 
serious logical rigour and gave me a first taste of programming using languages like R and Matlab, but I also see many parallels between my previous strategy work, 
and that of a Data Scientist, namely working with complex problems, developing specialist subject knowledge, and communicating and collaborating with a range of
stakeholders and clients.

Primarily using Python, I've been spending my spare time applying Data Science to a wide range of topics, from trying to gain an edge on my competitors in Fantasy 
Premier League, to making some visualisations of the Tate Collection and forecasting sales and advertising data using time series.
